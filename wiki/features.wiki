== caching data on client side ==
to reduce response time information is cached on client side. this reduces the number of callbacks to the server. currently this is only done for relate fields and relationship information.

== contacts csv import from sugarcrm == 
contact data exported via the default csv export from sugarcrm can be imported into honeycrm using the admin panel. currently not all fields are mapped into honeycrm.

== full text search ==
users can do full text searches globally (across all modules) as well as within the scope of a particular module (e.g., "all contacts containing the word 'hidden' in some field).

== ideas about future features ==

== versioning ==
almost (?) everything should be automatically versioned. it should be possible to track modifications between two versions.

''
The examples above demonstrated using events to update a lastUpdated and dateCreated property to keep track of updates to objects. However, this is actually not necessary. By merely defining a lastUpdated and dateCreated property these will be automatically updated for you by GORM.
''

== reports ==
we need a powerful solution to configure reports that should be automatically generated.

== searching ==
fulltext search is one requirement. additionally users may want to store configured searches and to them again similiar to reports. maybe we do not need stored searches if we implement reports properly.
 * fulltext search is easy to setup with the searchable plugin, see http://www.grails.org/dist/screencasts/screencast2.mov
 * problems
   * when searchable is enabled: yui datatable stays empty. elements are only listed with default listview specified in list.gsp
   * when querying for numbers it is not clear why the results are computed
   * the generated searchable controller does not work at all compared to the screencast
 * the fields for advanced searches should appear above the listview of each module. it should be an expandable panel.
 * users should be able to store searches and reuse them. they should appear in the ui as links that open the listview with a query.

== tagging ==
you will collect a lot of information when you run the crm. thus powerful search should be possible that could be supported by tagging. 

== some collaborative stuff ==
 * indicate that another user is currently logged in
 * indicate that another user is currently editing the same thing 
 * inspiration (?) from http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/
